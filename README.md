# My workspace for Digital Methods for Historians 2019

This repository consists of two parts

### Learning Journal
The first part of this repository is my learning journal from the course "Digital methods for Historians 2019" and the other being my final project for the course. The learning journal is straight forward and consists of descriptions on some homework done for classes. It also consists of some reflections on my final project and I have even used it for storing questions for some of the data carpentry exercises. It is not in anyway perfect in the way it is done. This form reflects how my learning curve has been in this course.

### Final Project
My final project consists of a python script that can extract annotations and highlights from PDF files. This script is made by Andrew Baumann and I have used the R package "reticulate" to be able to run the script through R. Furthermore I have made some additions to running the script in R. Before the script gave some spaces and tabs, which could disturb the reading of the output. My R script is removing these whitespaces and produces a more readable output of the annotations and highlights.

##### Prerequisits for the final project script 
To run the script (pdfannots_inR.R) in its full extent I recommend reading the Proof of concept document (DM_Proof_of_concept.pdf). The script should be useable without the need of the proof of concept paper (DM_Proof_of_concept.pdf), but the proof of concept paper (DM_Proof_of_concept.pdf) might make more sense when read besides the script itself.
