# My workspace for Digital Methods for Historians 2019

This repository consists of two parts

##### Learning Journal
The first being my learning journal from the course "Digital methods for Historians 2019" and the other being my final project for that course. The learning journal is straight forward. It consists of some notes on some homework done for classes. Some reflections on my final project and I have even used it as my place for storing questions for some of the data carpentry exercises. It is not in anyway perfect or stringent in the way it is done. I belive that this form of it reflects how my learning curve in this course has been.

##### Final Project
My final project consists of a python script that can extract annotations and highlights from PDF files. This script is made by Andrew Baumann, what i have done is i have used the R package "reticulate" to be able to run the script through R. Furthermore I have made some additions to running the script in R. Before the script gave some spaces and tabs, which could disturb the reading of the output. My R script is removing these whitespaces and produces an easilier readable output of the annotations and highlights.
